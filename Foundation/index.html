        <h4>Preface to the Project Gutenberg Etext</h4>
        <p>
            When Lionel Giles began his translation of Sun Tzŭ’s Art of War, the
            work was virtually unknown in Europe. Its introduction to Europe
            began in 1782 when a French Jesuit Father living in China, Joseph
            Amiot, acquired a copy of it, and translated it into French. It was
            not a good translation because, according to Dr. Giles, "[I]t
            contains a great deal that Sun Tzŭ did not write, and very little
            indeed of what he did."
        </p>
        <p>
            The first translation into English was published in 1905 in Tokyo by
            Capt. E. F. Calthrop, R.F.A. However, this translation is, in the
            words of Dr. Giles, "excessively bad." He goes further in this
            criticism: "It is not merely a question of downright blunders, from
            which none can hope to be wholly exempt. Omissions were frequent;
            hard passages were willfully distorted or slurred over. Such
            offenses are less pardonable. They would not be tolerated in any
            edition of a Latin or Greek classic, and a similar standard of
            honesty ought to be insisted upon in translations from Chinese." In
            1908 a new edition of Capt. Calthrop’s translation was published in
            London. It was an improvement on the first—omissions filled up and
            numerous mistakes corrected—but new errors were created in the
            process. Dr. Giles, in justifying his translation, wrote: "It was
            not undertaken out of any inflated estimate of my own powers; but I
            could not help feeling that Sun Tzŭ deserved a better fate than had
            befallen him, and I knew that, at any rate, I could hardly fail to
            improve on the work of my predecessors."
        </p>
        <p>
            Clearly, Dr. Giles’ work established much of the groundwork for the
            work of later translators who published their own editions. Of the
            later editions of the Art of War I have examined; two feature Giles’
            edited translation and notes, the other two present the same basic
            information from the ancient Chinese commentators found in the Giles
            edition. Of these four, Giles’ 1910 edition is the most scholarly
            and presents the reader an incredible amount of information
            concerning Sun Tzŭ’s text, much more than any other translation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Giles’ edition of the Art of War, as stated above, was a
            scholarly work. Dr. Giles was a leading sinologue at the time and an
            assistant in the Department of Oriental Printed Books and
            Manuscripts in the British Museum. Apparently he wanted to produce a
            definitive edition, superior to anything else that existed and
            perhaps something that would become a standard translation. It was
            the best translation available for 50 years. But apparently there
            was not much interest in Sun Tzŭ in English-speaking countries since
            it took the start of the Second World War to renew interest in his
            work. Several people published unsatisfactory English translations
            of Sun Tzŭ. In 1944, Dr. Giles’ translation was edited and published
            in the United States in a series of military science books. But it
            wasn’t until 1963 that a good English translation (by Samuel B.
            Griffith and still in print) was published that was an equal to
            Giles’ translation. While this translation is more lucid than Dr.
            Giles’ translation, it lacks his copious notes that make his so
            interesting.
